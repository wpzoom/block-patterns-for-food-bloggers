**What is a WordPress pattern?**
A WordPress pattern is a collection of blocks arranged together into an thoughtful, intentional, opinionated section for a page of post. Once inserted into a page, the author can edit and customize the blocks to their needs.

Patterns make it incredibly simple to add complex layouts and designs to any WordPress site without having to start from scratch every time. Patterns can also highlight and expose features and combinations of blocks that may not be immediately obvious or intuitive.


== Included patterns: ==

* **Recipe Index**
* **Search Bar**
* **Hero**
* **Newsletter**
* **Book Feature**
* **About Author**
* **Instagram Hero**
* **Featured Category**
* **Latest Posts (overlay style)**

== Recommended Themes & DEMO ==

Even though the plugin works great with any theme, currently, it includes patterns that were thoroughly tested with the following WPZOOM themes:

[**Foodica PRO**](https://www.wpzoom.com/themes/foodica/)
[**CookBook**](https://www.wpzoom.com/themes/cookbook/) - *NEW*

[**Cookely**](https://www.wpzoom.com/themes/cookely/)

= Quick Tips =
Use the Group block to control spacing and color for more than one block at a time.
Use the Cover block to control your pattern’s height, including min-height and full-viewport designs.
If your pattern contains numerous root-level blocks it can be helpful to Group them all together. This makes it easier to move your pattern around once inserted.
